Add language-specific README.md files for JavaScript and Rust implementations

- Create js/README.md with npm-specific documentation (installation, development, publishing)
- Create rust/README.md with cargo-specific documentation (build, features, status)
- Update root README.md to serve as common entry point for both implementations
- Update package.json files array to include js/README.md for npm package
