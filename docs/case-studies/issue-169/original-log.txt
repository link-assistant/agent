AudioManager (`scripts/autoload/audio_manager.gd`)**\n- Added new constant `SHOTGUN_DRY_FIRE` pointing to `попытка выстрела без заряда ДРОБОВИК.mp3`\n- Added new method `play_shotgun_dry_fire(position)` to play the dry fire sound\n- Added the sound to the preload list for caching\n\n**2. Shotgun (`Scripts/Weapons/Shotgun.cs`)**\n- Added new method `PlayDryFireSound()` that calls `play_shotgun_dry_fire`\n- Updated `Fire()` method (line 1476) to call `PlayDryFireSound()` when the shotgun is not ready to fire (needs pump action)\n- Kept `PlayEmptyClickSound()` for when the tube is empty (line 1483)\n\n### Behavior\n\nThe shotgun now plays distinct sounds for different failure conditions:\n\n- **Not ready to fire** (needs pump): Plays `попытка выстрела без заряда ДРОБОВИК.mp3` - occurs when player tries to fire without cycling the pump after the previous shot\n- **Tube empty**: Plays `выстрел без патронов дробовик.mp3` - occurs when there are no shells left\n\n### Pull Request\n\nThe changes have been committed and pushed to branch `issue-761-a0caf45f6eba`. \n\n**PR #778**: https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pull/778\n\nThe PR has been marked as ready for review with a detailed description of the implementation.",
