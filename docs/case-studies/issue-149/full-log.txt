PR review comments (inline code comments): gh api repos/netkeep80/isocubic/pulls/207/comments --paginate\n      2. PR conversation comments (general discussion): gh api repos/netkeep80/isocubic/issues/207/comments --paginate\n      3.

Типы и утилиты (src/types/, src/lib/) остаются практически без изменений — они framework-agnostic\n00026| 2. Компоненты переписываются с JSX/TSX на Vue SFC (Single File Components) с `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n00027| 3. React hooks → Vue Composition API (ref, reactive, computed, watch, onMounted)\n00028| 4. React Context → Vue provide/inject или Pinia stores\n00029| 5. GLSL-шейдеры остаются без изменений\n00030| 6.
