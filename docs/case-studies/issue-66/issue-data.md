## Issue #66 Data

### Original Issue Description

Issue: Full support for Gemini oAuth (subscriptions login)

At the moment we only support API token, but we need to also to support Gemini subscriptions with oAuth (or similar flow) like we do for Claude Pro/Max subscriptions.

We should use reference code at ./original-opencode and ./reference-gemini-cli.

Please download all logs and data related about the issue to this repository, make sure we compile that data to ./docs/case-studies/issue-{id} folder, and use it to do deep case study analysis (also make sure to search online for additional facts and data), in which we will reconstruct timeline/sequence of events, find root causes of the problem, and propose possible solutions.
