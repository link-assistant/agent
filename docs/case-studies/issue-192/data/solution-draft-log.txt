When you manage commits, preserve commit history for later analysis.\n   - When you contribute, keep repository history forward-moving with regular commits, pushes, and reverts if needed.\n   - When you face conflict that you cannot resolve yourself, ask for help.\n   - When you collaborate, respect branch protections by working only on issue-766-8327585e8ded.\n   - When you mention result, include pull request url or comment url.\n   - When you need to create pr, remember pr 780 already exists for this branch.\nSelf review.\n   - When you check your solution draft, run all tests locally.\n   - When you check your solution draft, verify git status shows a clean working tree with no uncommitted changes.\n   - When you compare with repo style, use gh pr diff [number].\n   - When you finalize, confirm code, tests, and description are consistent.\nGitHub CLI command patterns.\n   - IMPORTANT: Always use --paginate flag when fetching lists from GitHub API to ensure all results are returned (GitHub returns max 30 per page by default).\n   -

When you need human help, use gh pr comment 780 --body \"your message\" to comment on existing PR.\nPreparing pull request.\n   - When you code, follow contributing guidelines.\n   - When you commit, write clear message.\n   - When you need examples of style, use gh pr list --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --state merged --search [keywords].\n   - When you open pr, describe solution draft and include tests.\n   - When there is a package with version and GitHub Actions workflows for automatic release, update the version in your pull request to prepare for next release.\n   - When you update existing pr 780, use gh pr edit to modify title and description.\n   - When you finalize the pull request:\n      check that pull request title and description are updated (the PR may start with a [WIP] prefix and placeholder description that should be replaced with actual title and description of the changes),\n      follow style from merged prs for code, title, and description,\n      make sure no uncommitted changes corresponding to the original requirements are left behind,\n      make sure the default branch is merged to the pull request's branch,\n      make sure all CI checks passing if they exist before you finish,\n      check for latest comments on the issue and pull request to ensure no recent feedback was missed,\n      double-check that all changes in the pull request answer to original requirements of the issue,\n      make sure no new bugs are introduced in pull request by carefully reading gh pr diff,\n      make sure no previously existing features were removed without an explicit request from users via the issue description, issue comments, and/or pull request comments.\n   - When you finish implementation, use gh pr ready 780.\nWorkflow and collaboration.\n   - When you check branch, verify with git branch --show-current.\n   - When you push, push only to branch issue-766-8327585e8ded.\n   - When you finish, create a pull request from branch issue-766-8327585e8ded.\n   - When pr 780 already exists for this branch, update it instead of creating new one.\n   - When you organize workflow, use pull requests instead of direct merges to default branch (main or master).\n   - When you manage commits, preserve commit history for later analysis.\n   - When you contribute, keep repository history forward-moving with regular commits, pushes, and reverts if needed.\n   - When you face conflict that you cannot resolve yourself, ask for help.\n   - When you collaborate, respect branch protections by working only on issue-766-8327585e8ded.\n   - When you mention result, include pull request url or comment url.\n   - When you need to create pr, remember pr 780 already exists for this branch.\nSelf review.\n   - When you check your solution draft, run all tests locally.\n   - When you check your solution draft, verify git status shows a clean working tree with no uncommitted changes.\n   - When you compare with repo style, use gh pr diff [number].\n   - When you finalize, confirm code, tests, and description are consistent.\nGitHub CLI command patterns.\n   - IMPORTANT: Always use --paginate flag when fetching lists from GitHub API to ensure all results are returned (GitHub returns max 30 per page by default).\n   - When listing PR review comments (inline code comments), use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When listing PR conversation comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When listing PR reviews, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/reviews --paginate.\n   - When listing issue comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When adding PR comment, use gh pr comment NUMBER --body \"text\" --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When adding issue comment, use gh issue comment NUMBER --body \"text\" --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When viewing PR details, use gh pr view NUMBER --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When filtering with jq, use gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/780/comments --paginate --jq 'reverse | .[0:5]'.\nIssue to solve: https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/766\nYour prepared branch: issue-766-8327585e8ded\nYour prepared working directory: /tmp/gh-issue-solver-1771236731367\nYour prepared Pull Request: https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pull/780\nYour forked repository: konard/Jhon-Crow-godot-topdown-MVP\nOriginal repository (upstream): Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP\nGitHub Actions on your fork: https://github.com/konard/Jhon-Crow-godot-topdown-MVP/actions?query=branch%3Aissue-766-8327585e8ded\nNew comments on the pull request: 2\nPull request description was edited after last commit\nContinue."
