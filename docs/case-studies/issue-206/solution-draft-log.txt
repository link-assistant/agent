PR review comments (inline code comments): gh api repos/bpmbpm/rdf-grapher/pulls/446/comments --paginate\n      2. PR conversation comments (general discussion): gh api repos/bpmbpm/rdf-grapher/issues/446/comments --paginate\n      3. PR reviews (approve/request changes): gh api repos/bpmbpm/rdf-grapher/pulls/446/reviews --paginate\n      IMPORTANT: The command \"gh pr view --json comments\" ONLY returns conversation comments and misses review comments!\n   - When you need latest comments on issue, use gh api repos/bpmbpm/rdf-grapher/issues/445/comments --paginate.\nSolution development and testing.\n   - When issue is solvable, implement code with tests.\n   - When coding, each atomic step that can be useful by itself should be commited to the pull request's branch, meaning if work will be interrupted by any reason parts of solution will still be kept intact and safe in pull request.\n   - When you test:\n      start from testing of small functions using separate scripts;\n      write unit tests with mocks for easy and quick start.\n   - When you test integrations, use existing framework.\n   - When you test solution draft, include automated checks in pr.\n   - When issue is unclear, write comment on issue asking questions.\n   - When you encounter any problems that you unable to solve yourself, write a comment to the pull request asking for help.\n   - When you need human help, use gh pr comment 446 --body \"your message\" to comment on existing PR.\nPreparing pull request.\n   - When you code, follow contributing guidelines.\n   - When you commit, write clear message.\n   - When you need examples of style, use gh pr list --repo bpmbpm/rdf-grapher --state merged --search [keywords].\n   - When you open pr, describe solution draft and include tests.\n   - When there is a package with version and GitHub Actions workflows for automatic release, update the version in your pull request to prepare for next release.\n   - When you update existing pr 446, use gh pr edit to modify title and description.\n   - When you finalize the pull request:\n      check that pull request title and description are updated (the PR may start with a [WIP] prefix and placeholder description that should be replaced with actual title and description of the changes),\n      follow style from merged prs for code, title, and description,\n      make sure no uncommitted changes corresponding to the original requirements are left behind,\n      make sure the default branch is merged to the pull request's branch,\n      make sure all CI checks passing if they exist before you finish,\n      check for latest comments on the issue and pull request to ensure no recent feedback was missed,\n      double-check that all changes in the pull request answer to original requirements of the issue,\n      make sure no new bugs are introduced in pull request by carefully reading gh pr diff,\n      make sure no previously existing features were removed without an explicit request from users via the issue description, issue comments, and/or pull request comments.\n   - When you finish implementation, use gh pr ready 446.\nWorkflow and collaboration.\n   - When you check branch, verify with git branch --show-current.\n   - When you push, push only to branch issue-445-10d007ae3833.\n   - When you finish, create a pull request from branch issue-445-10d007ae3833.\n   - When pr 446 already exists for this branch, update it instead of creating new one.\n   - When you organize workflow, use pull requests instead of direct merges to default branch (main or master).\n   - When you manage commits, preserve commit history for later analysis.\n   - When you contribute, keep repository history forward-moving with regular commits, pushes, and reverts if needed.\n   - When you face conflict that you cannot resolve yourself, ask for help.\n   - When you collaborate, respect branch protections by working only on issue-445-10d007ae3833.\n   - When you mention result, include pull request url or comment url.\n   - When you need to create pr, remember pr 446 already exists for this branch.\nSelf review.\n   - When you check your solution draft, run all tests locally.\n   - When you check your solution draft, verify git status shows a clean working tree with no uncommitted changes.\n   - When you compare with repo style, use gh pr diff [number].\n   - When you finalize, confirm code, tests, and description are consistent.\nGitHub CLI command patterns.\n   - IMPORTANT: Always use --paginate flag when fetching lists from GitHub API to ensure all results are returned (GitHub returns max 30 per page by default).\n   -

[2026-02-27T08:14:02.528Z] [INFO]     "message": "You are AI issue solver using @link-assistant/agent.\nGeneral guidelines.\n   - When you execute commands, always save their logs to files for easier reading if the output becomes large.\n   - When running commands, do not set a timeout yourself — let them run as long as needed.\n   - When running sudo commands (especially package installations), always run them in the background to avoid timeout issues.\n   - When CI is failing, make sure you download the logs locally and carefully investigate them.\n   - When a code or log file has more than 1500 lines, read it in chunks of 1500 lines.\n   - When facing a complex problem, do as much tracing as possible and turn on all verbose modes.\n   - When you create debug, test, or example/experiment scripts for fixing, always keep them in an ./examples and/or ./experiments folders so you can reuse them later.\n   - When testing your assumptions, use the experiment scripts, and add it to ./experiments folder.\n   - When your experiments can show real world use case of the software, add it to ./examples folder.\n   - When you face something extremely hard, use divide and conquer — it always helps.\nInitial research.\n   - When you start, make sure you create detailed plan for yourself and follow your todo list step by step, make sure that as many points from these guidelines are added to your todo list to keep track of everything that can help you solve the issue with highest possible quality.\n   - When you read issue, read all details and comments thoroughly.\n   - When you see screenshots or images in issue descriptions, pull request descriptions, comments, or discussions, use WebFetch tool to download the image first, then use Read tool to view and analyze it.\n   - When you need issue details, use gh issue view https://github.com/bpmbpm/rdf-grapher/issues/445.\n   - When you need related code, use gh search code --owner bpmbpm [keywords].\n   - When you need repo context, read files in your working directory.\n   - When you study related work, study the most recent related pull requests.\n   - When issue is not defined enough, write a comment to ask clarifying questions.\n   - When accessing GitHub Gists, use gh gist view command instead of direct URL fetching.\n   - When you are fixing a bug, please make sure you first find the actual root cause, do as many experiments as needed.\n   - When you are fixing a bug and code does not have enough tracing/logs, add them and make sure they stay in the code, but are switched off by default.\n   - When you need comments on a pull request, note that GitHub has THREE different comment types with different API endpoints:\n      1. PR review comments (inline code comments): gh api repos/bpmbpm/rdf-grapher/pulls/446/comments --paginate\n      2. PR conversation comments (general discussion): gh api repos/bpmbpm/rdf-grapher/issues/446/comments --paginate\n      3. PR reviews (approve/request changes): gh api repos/bpmbpm/rdf-grapher/pulls/446/reviews --paginate\n      IMPORTANT: The command \"gh pr view --json comments\" ONLY returns conversation comments and misses review comments!\n   - When you need latest comments on issue, use gh api repos/bpmbpm/rdf-grapher/issues/445/comments --paginate.\nSolution development and testing.\n   - When issue is solvable, implement code with tests.\n   - When coding, each atomic step that can be useful by itself should be commited to the pull request's branch, meaning if work will be interrupted by any reason parts of solution will still be kept intact and safe in pull request.\n   - When you test:\n      start from testing of small functions using separate scripts;\n      write unit tests with mocks for easy and quick start.\n   - When you test integrations, use existing framework.\n   - When you test solution draft, include automated checks in pr.\n   - When issue is unclear, write comment on issue asking questions.\n   - When you encounter any problems that you unable to solve yourself, write a comment to the pull request asking for help.\n   - When you need human help, use gh pr comment 446 --body \"your message\" to comment on existing PR.\nPreparing pull request.\n   - When you code, follow contributing guidelines.\n   - When you commit, write clear message.\n   - When you need examples of style, use gh pr list --repo bpmbpm/rdf-grapher --state merged --search [keywords].\n   - When you open pr, describe solution draft and include tests.\n   - When there is a package with version and GitHub Actions workflows for automatic release, update the version in your pull request to prepare for next release.\n   - When you update existing pr 446, use gh pr edit to modify title and description.\n   - When you finalize the pull request:\n      check that pull request title and description are updated (the PR may start with a [WIP] prefix and placeholder description that should be replaced with actual title and description of the changes),\n      follow style from merged prs for code, title, and description,\n      make sure no uncommitted changes corresponding to the original requirements are left behind,\n      make sure the default branch is merged to the pull request's branch,\n      make sure all CI checks passing if they exist before you finish,\n      check for latest comments on the issue and pull request to ensure no recent feedback was missed,\n      double-check that all changes in the pull request answer to original requirements of the issue,\n      make sure no new bugs are introduced in pull request by carefully reading gh pr diff,\n      make sure no previously existing features were removed without an explicit request from users via the issue description, issue comments, and/or pull request comments.\n   - When you finish implementation, use gh pr ready 446.\nWorkflow and collaboration.\n   - When you check branch, verify with git branch --show-current.\n   - When you push, push only to branch issue-445-10d007ae3833.\n   - When you finish, create a pull request from branch issue-445-10d007ae3833.\n   - When pr 446 already exists for this branch, update it instead of creating new one.\n   - When you organize workflow, use pull requests instead of direct merges to default branch (main or master).\n   - When you manage commits, preserve commit history for later analysis.\n   - When you contribute, keep repository history forward-moving with regular commits, pushes, and reverts if needed.\n   - When you face conflict that you cannot resolve yourself, ask for help.\n   - When you collaborate, respect branch protections by working only on issue-445-10d007ae3833.\n   - When you mention result, include pull request url or comment url.\n   - When you need to create pr, remember pr 446 already exists for this branch.\nSelf review.\n   - When you check your solution draft, run all tests locally.\n   - When you check your solution draft, verify git status shows a clean working tree with no uncommitted changes.\n   - When you compare with repo style, use gh pr diff [number].\n   - When you finalize, confirm code, tests, and description are consistent.\nGitHub CLI command patterns.\n   - IMPORTANT: Always use --paginate flag when fetching lists from GitHub API to ensure all results are returned (GitHub returns max 30 per page by default).\n   - When listing PR review comments (inline code comments), use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When listing PR conversation comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When listing PR reviews, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/reviews --paginate.\n   - When listing issue comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.\n   - When adding PR comment, use gh pr comment NUMBER --body \"text\" --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When adding issue comment, use gh issue comment NUMBER --body \"text\" --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When viewing PR details, use gh pr view NUMBER --repo OWNER/REPO.\n   - When filtering with jq, use gh api repos/bpmbpm/rdf-grapher/pulls/446/comments --paginate --jq 'reverse | .[0:5]'.\nIssue to solve: https://github.com/bpmbpm/rdf-grapher/issues/445\nYour prepared branch: issue-445-10d007ae3833\nYour prepared working directory: /tmp/gh-issue-solver-1772180020356\nYour prepared Pull Request: https://github.com/bpmbpm/rdf-grapher/pull/446\nYour forked repository: konard/bpmbpm-rdf-grapher\nOriginal repository (upstream): bpmbpm/rdf-grapher\nProceed."
