  "body": "Requirements:\n\n- [x] https://github.com/link-assistant/agent/issues/39\n\nWe should make sure that reading of image with read tool will not lead to agent process crush or API error if it is not really and image, but something else (or not image in the correct format). In such case our tool should just report an error to AI, so it can have enough information to correct itself.\n\nhttps://github.com/link-assistant/hive-mind/issues/597\n\nThat is potential bug, for which we need to have tests first. And that test should be possible to execute manually in CI and locally. As now we have Claude Code oAuth connected, we may just use it locally to check that it can read image correctly. We need to make sure we create an image by making wrong download that should be html instead of image, and we should try to read such file, in Claude Code CLI it will defenitely fail, but in our agent tool we don't know. And if also does fail we can make our Read tool better by verifying if we read image in the correct format.\n\nThat verification should be optional, so we can disable it at any time. Like `--verify-images-at-read-tool` which will be enabled by default with ability to disable.\n\nPlease download all logs and data related about the issue to this repository, make sure we compile that data to `./docs/case-studies/issue-{id}` folder, and use it to do deep case study analysis (also make sure to search online for additional facts and data), in which we will reconstruct timeline/sequence of events, find root causes of the problem, and propose possible solutions.",
