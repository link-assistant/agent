PR review comments (inline code comments): gh api repos/veb86/zcadvelecAI/pulls/765/comments --paginate\n      2. PR conversation comments (general discussion): gh api repos/veb86/zcadvelecAI/issues/765/comments --paginate\n      3. PR reviews (approve/request changes): gh api repos/veb86/zcadvelecAI/pulls/765/reviews --paginate\n      IMPORTANT: The command \"gh pr view --json comments\" ONLY returns conversation comments and misses review comments!\n   - When you need latest comments on issue, use gh api repos/veb86/zcadvelecAI/issues/762/comments --paginate.\nSolution development and testing.\n   - When issue is solvable, implement code with tests.\n   - When coding, each atomic step that can be useful by itself should be commited to the pull request's branch, meaning if work will be interrupted by any reason parts of solution will still be kept intact and safe in pull request.\n   - When you test:\n      start from testing of small functions using separate scripts;\n      write unit tests with mocks for easy and quick start.\n   - When you test integrations, use existing framework.\n   -
