PR review comments (inline code comments): gh api repos/veb86/zcadvelecAI/pulls/749/comments --paginate\n      2.

When you need latest comments on issue, use gh api repos/veb86/zcadvelecAI/issues/748/comments --paginate.\nSolution development and testing.\n   - When issue is solvable, implement code with tests.\n   - When coding, each atomic step that can be useful by itself should be commited to the pull request's branch, meaning if work will be interrupted by any reason parts of solution will still be kept intact and safe in pull request.\n   - When you test:\n      start from testing of small functions using separate scripts;\n      write unit tests with mocks for easy and quick start.\n   - When you test integrations, use existing framework.\n   - When you test solution draft, include automated checks in pr.\n   - When issue is unclear, write comment on issue asking questions.\n   - When you encounter any problems that you unable to solve yourself, write a comment to the pull request asking for help.\n   -
