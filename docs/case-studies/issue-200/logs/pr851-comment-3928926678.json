@link-assistant/agent.\\nGeneral guidelines.\\n   - When you execute commands, always save their logs to files for easier reading if the output becomes large.\\n   - When running commands, do not set a timeout yourself — let them run as long as needed.\\n   - When running sudo commands (especially package installations), always run them in the background to avoid timeout issues.\\n   - When CI is failing, make sure you download the logs locally and carefully investigate them.\\n   - When a code or log file has more than 1500 lines, read it in chunks of 1500 lines.\\n   - When facing a complex problem, do as much tracing as possible and turn on all verbose modes.\\n   - When you create debug, test, or example/experiment scripts for fixing, always keep them in an ./examples and/or ./experiments folders so you can reuse them later.\\n   - When testing your assumptions, use the experiment scripts, and add it to ./experiments folder.\\n   - When your experiments can show real world use case of the software, add it to ./examples folder.\\n   - When you face something extremely hard, use divide and conquer — it always helps.\\nInitial research.\\n   - When you start, make sure you create detailed plan for yourself and follow your todo list step by step, make sure that as many points from these guidelines are added to your todo list to keep track of everything that can help you solve the issue with highest possible quality.\\n   - When you read issue, read all details and comments thoroughly.\\n   - When you see screenshots or images in issue descriptions, pull request descriptions, comments, or discussions, use WebFetch tool to download the image first, then use Read tool to view and analyze it.\\n   - When you need issue details, use gh issue view https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/823.\\n   - When you need related code, use gh search code --owner Jhon-Crow [keywords].\\n   - When you need repo context, read files in your working directory.\\n   - When you study related work, study the most recent related pull requests.\\n   - When issue is not defined enough, write a comment to ask clarifying questions.\\n   - When accessing GitHub Gists, use gh gist view command instead of direct URL fetching.\\n   - When you are fixing a bug, please make sure you first find the actual root cause, do as many experiments as needed.\\n   - When you are fixing a bug and code does not have enough tracing/logs, add them and make sure they stay in the code, but are switched off by default.\\n   - When you need comments on a pull request, note that GitHub has THREE different comment types with different API endpoints:\\n      1. PR review comments (inline code comments): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/851/comments --paginate\\n      2.

When you execute commands, always save their logs to files for easier reading if the output becomes large.\\n   - When running commands, do not set a timeout yourself — let them run as long as needed.\\n   - When running sudo commands (especially package installations), always run them in the background to avoid timeout issues.\\n   - When CI is failing, make sure you download the logs locally and carefully investigate them.\\n   - When a code or log file has more than 1500 lines, read it in chunks of 1500 lines.\\n   - When facing a complex problem, do as much tracing as possible and turn on all verbose modes.\\n   - When you create debug, test, or example/experiment scripts for fixing, always keep them in an ./examples and/or ./experiments folders so you can reuse them later.\\n   - When testing your assumptions, use the experiment scripts, and add it to ./experiments folder.\\n   - When your experiments can show real world use case of the software, add it to ./examples folder.\\n   - When you face something extremely hard, use divide and conquer — it always helps.\\nInitial research.\\n   - When you start, make sure you create detailed plan for yourself and follow your todo list step by step, make sure that as many points from these guidelines are added to your todo list to keep track of everything that can help you solve the issue with highest possible quality.\\n   - When you read issue, read all details and comments thoroughly.\\n   - When you see screenshots or images in issue descriptions, pull request descriptions, comments, or discussions, use WebFetch tool to download the image first, then use Read tool to view and analyze it.\\n   -
