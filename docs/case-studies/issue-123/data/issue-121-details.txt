We should use [js] prefix in name, version is fine.

But the description of the release must be like in https://github.com/link-foundation/js-ai-driven-development-pipeline-template

Please use all latest best practices of https://github.com/link-foundation/js-ai-driven-development-pipeline-template for our JavaScript CI/CD. If we have something even better - please file issue to https://github.com/link-foundation/js-ai-driven-development-pipeline-template with proposal.
