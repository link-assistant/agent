Read the correct changelog file based on the prefix\n2. Format release names with brackets around the prefix\n\n## Test plan\n- [ ] Verify next release uses `[js]` prefix format in the release name\n- [ ] Verify next release description contains actual changelog content\n- [ ] Verify PR link and npm badge appear in release notes\n\nFixes #121\n\n---\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)","commits":[{"authoredDate":"2026-01-13T21:03:41Z","authors":[{"email":"drakonard@gmail.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","login":"konard","name":"konard"}],"committedDate":"2026-01-13T21:03:41Z","messageBody":"Adding CLAUDE.md with task information for AI processing.\nThis file will be removed when the task is complete.\n\nIssue: https://github.com/link-assistant/agent/issues/121","messageHeadline":"Initial commit with task details","oid":"c662d6518214a71b186e6b9a14f165067b9a45ed"},{"authoredDate":"2026-01-13T21:07:35Z","authors":[{"email":"drakonard@gmail.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","login":"konard","name":"konard"},{"email":"noreply@anthropic.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxODQ3","login":"claude","name":"Claude Opus 4.5"}],"committedDate":"2026-01-13T21:07:35Z","messageBody":"- Fix release name format to use [js] prefix (e.g., \"[js] 0.8.4\")\n- Fix changelog path for js releases to use js/CHANGELOG.md\n- Ensures releases have proper descriptions with PR links and npm badges\n\nFixes #121\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>","messageHeadline":"fix: align GitHub release style with template repository","oid":"afcd2f83ac180e5668eed315e915a2f0bac917a6"},{"authoredDate":"2026-01-13T21:11:14Z","authors":[{"email":"drakonard@gmail.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","login":"konard","name":"konard"},{"email":"noreply@anthropic.com","id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxODQ3","login":"claude","name":"Claude Opus 4.5"}],"committedDate":"2026-01-13T21:11:14Z","messageBody":"Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>","messageHeadline":"chore: remove automated setup file","oid":"9c45b0443b7b72c1782fd5721d30debfe107af09"}],"files":[{"path":"js/.changeset/fix-release-style.md","additions":11,"deletions":0},{"path":"scripts/create-github-release.mjs","additions":14,"deletions":3}],"mergedAt":"2026-01-16T06:26:26Z","title":"fix: align GitHub release style with template repository"}
