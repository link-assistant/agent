## [0.22.0] - 2026-11-06

### Changed
- Automatically require native JavaScript, strict parity and regeneration checks when a production counterpart is detected, while preserving Rust-only projects. Bind Rust CI, desktop builds and release candidates to the successful prerequisite's exact revision.

### Added
- Regression coverage for automatic detection, Rust-only bypasses, failed or skipped prerequisites, incomplete inventories, generated drift and every downstream Rust dependency.
- Validate alternative candidate provenance before checking out code in default-branch cache contexts; enforce tested-revision equality before release-tag builds.

### Added
- `rerun-infrastructure-failures.yml` automatically reruns, at most twice, a failed run whose job GitHub never handed to a hosted runner ("The job was not acquired by Runner of type hosted even after multiple attempts"), so a macOS capacity shortage no longer blocks a release on `main` until someone reruns it by hand. Jobs that ran steps and failed, and superseded runs, are never rerun (issue #226).

### Changed
- The Pipeline Status gate names jobs that never got a runner with a `Hosted runner not acquired` error. It stays red because nothing was tested; its job now has `actions: read` and `checks: read` to read the run's jobs and annotations.

### Fixed
- Preserve adjacent lychee failures and restrict retry parsing to the error section.
- Reject incomplete CodeQL extraction and configuration diagnostics even when analysis reports success with no findings.
- Scan every tracked file for credentials regardless of build ignores, including bounded decompression of gzip evidence, using locked secretlint dependencies.
- Fail change detection on unreadable Git evidence and preserve successful empty diffs without falling back to an all-files listing.
## [0.21.0] - 2026-10-30

### Added
- Add an opt-in JavaScript-first prerequisite with a working mixed-language example, strict readiness inventory, deterministic translation and exact-revision Rust/container checks.
- Audit every tracked shell script and probe Dependency Graph availability with bounded retries and actionable main-branch failures.

### Fixed
- Gate releases on every required check, preserve queued writers, and prefer crates.io trusted publishing with token fallback.
- Use pull request head revisions for cancellation checks, support the template's ref-based concurrency expressions, and prevent execution budgets from expiring early.
- Support multiline fresh-merge checks, author-based Dependabot changelog exemptions and dedicated release-PR credentials.
- Update action versions and runner labels, persist link-check caches and reports, and remove legacy file-size exceptions by splitting large modules.

### Fixed
- Check source file sizes using relative path components, including `.github` and files whose names contain `target`.
- Retry transient registry and Wayback failures and stop release or archive decisions when the lookup remains unavailable.
- Reject missing or malformed link reports and unresolved CodeQL findings while retaining diagnostic artifacts.
- Preserve fenced changelog examples and all following release notes; refuse missing required entries.
- Download digest-verified artifact ZIPs without deprecated Buffer constructors and safely extract them with Python.
- Keep macOS arm64 desktop builds running on the supported macOS 15 runner after macOS 14 brownouts.
## [0.20.2] - 2026-10-10

### Fixed
- Fail every Rust Actions output producer when a configured output cannot be opened or written, while supporting local runs without GITHUB_OUTPUT.
- Report changelog directory, fragment-read and cleanup failures instead of silently skipping or losing release fragments.
- Match both local zizmor commands to the action's repository-wide scan, including Dependabot configurations.

## [0.20.1] - 2026-10-07

### Fixed
- Recognize replacement changelog fragments while excluding unchanged fragment moves, regardless of Git's rename configuration.
- Detect both paths of source moves so moving code into excluded folders still requires a changelog fragment and runs the code CI jobs.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added
- `release-preflight` job proves the crates.io and Docker Hub credentials can actually publish before the release matrix spends its minutes (#163, #167)
- `validate-docs` job verifies every required document and section, and `check-file-size.rs` now measures markdown against its own larger budget (#161)
- The link checker re-asks exactly the failures where no host ever answered and releases the run when they all recover; the Wayback lookup skips the recovered URLs (#168)

### Changed
- The pipeline status gate runs in every workflow and can tell a superseded run from a timeout on main (#156)
- cargo audit denies warnings, so `unmaintained`, `unsound` and `yanked` findings fail the gate (#164)
- actionlint is digest-pinned to 1.7.12 and the zizmor CLI version is named explicitly, matching the pin-everything policy (#160, #165, #166)
- Each buildx platform writes to its own GHA cache scope, so separate builds no longer evict each other (#154)

### Fixed
- `run-with-budget-warning.sh` measures elapsed wall-clock time, so a non-integer poll setting can no longer silently disable enforcement (#153)
- `rust-paths.rs` reads the crate name and version from the `[package]` table only, instead of a table-blind regex (#155)
- A transient `git fetch` failure no longer fails the whole fresh-merge job (#157)
- The leaked hive-mind `.gitkeep` placeholder is removed from the default branch (#158)
- The version commit is linted, formatted and tested before it is pushed to main (#159)
- Push retries classify GH006/GH013 ruleset rejections instead of rebasing three times and reporting the wrong cause (#162)

### Fixed

- Link recovery now considers every original failure, including final HTTP responses, before releasing the link-check gate (#170)
- Cancelled jobs are excused only when their own effective concurrency policy proves a superseding run could cancel them (#171)
- Step budgets isolate output from surviving descendants and can detect, terminate, and report privileged process-group survivors (#172)
- Manual changelog descriptions cannot inject GitHub Actions workflow commands through generated fragment output (#173)
- Changelog and version policy checks fail closed when their base diff is unavailable and retry after fetching the explicit base ref (#174)
- Pipeline status checks remain portable to the Bash 3.2 macOS runner, and the file-size gate freezes existing source debt while excluding generated changelog history

### Fixed
- Pin CI runners, rust-script and security scanners, and check tool installation in every job.
- Reject manual version changes, reused changelog fragments, Cargo manifest warnings and unrelated release-index changes.
- Verify scoped crates.io credentials through a metadata-only publish probe and keep publication tokens out of Cargo arguments.
- Retry transient link failures with bounded backoff, exclude experiments from CodeQL, remove duplicate doc tests and increase registry propagation wait margin.

## [0.19.35] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed
- Run the release-script unit tests in CI. `scripts/*.rs` carried 78 `#[test]` functions across nine rust-scripts and no workflow ran any of them: `cargo test` only builds the library crate, so the release-script regression guards -- including the rebase-before-stage ordering check in `version-and-commit.rs` -- had never executed. Two suites had rotted unnoticed as a result: `create-github-release.rs` did not compile in test mode (it declared `release_naming` only under `#[cfg(not(test))]` and substituted a `super::` path that does not exist when `rust-script --test` builds the file as its own crate root), and `version-and-commit.rs` and `wait-for-crate.rs` failed under the workflow-level `RUSTFLAGS: -Dwarnings` because a test harness has no `main`, leaving every `main`-only helper unused (#150).

### Added
- `scripts/test-scripts.sh` runs the inline `#[cfg(test)]` suite of every rust-script under `scripts/`, under the same `-Dwarnings` CI uses, reporting every failing suite instead of stopping at the first. A new `script-tests` job runs it, `build` is gated on it so a broken release script cannot reach `auto-release`, and `pipeline-status` observes it (#150).

## [0.19.34] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed
- Stop handing the crates.io publish credentials to every job in `release.yml`. `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` and `CARGO_TOKEN` were declared in the workflow-level `env:`, which is inherited by every job — including the `pull_request` jobs that compile and run code from the branch under review (`build.rs`, procedural macros, tests), so any branch pull request could read the publish token. The credentials now live only on the two publish steps that need them (#149).

## [0.19.33] - 2026-09-03

### Security
- Audit the GitHub Actions workflows with `zizmor` in `workflows.yml` and add `.github/zizmor.yml`, which requires hash pins for every action outside the trusted first-party namespaces (issue #147).
- Hash-pin `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` (restating `toolchain: stable`, which the mutable `stable` branch used to supply), `taiki-e/install-action`, `codecov/codecov-action`, and `peter-evans/create-pull-request`.
- Set `persist-credentials: false` on every read-only checkout, so `GITHUB_TOKEN` is no longer written to `.git/config` in jobs that never push.
- Pass `github.repository`, `github.server_url`, `github.run_id`, and `matrix.label` through `env:` instead of interpolating them into `run:` blocks.

## [0.19.32] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed
- `scripts/wait-for-crate.rs` no longer reports a successful release as failed when crates.io answers 403, 429 or a 5xx. The probe returns a `Visibility` (`Published` / `NotPublishedYet` / `Unknown`) instead of a bare `bool`, and when no attempt ever got a definitive answer the error says the release status is unknown and how to verify it against the sparse index, rather than claiming the version was never published (#143).

### Changed
- The crates.io wait probes the sparse index (`https://index.crates.io`), which is what `cargo` resolves against and is not rate limited, falling back to the JSON API.
- The wait's `User-Agent` now carries contact information, as crates.io asks of its clients.

## [0.19.31] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed
- `release.yml` built the multi-architecture manifest digest list with a single-quoted `printf` format, so `${DOCKERHUB_IMAGE}` was never expanded and `docker buildx imagetools create` received an invalid image reference (shellcheck SC2016).

### Added
- `workflows.yml` runs `actionlint` (Docker image, which bundles `shellcheck`) on every change under `.github/`, plus a `.github/actionlint.yaml` declaring the `macos-15-intel` and `windows-11-arm` runner labels the linter does not yet know.

## [0.19.30] - 2026-08-22

### Fixed
- `scripts/detect-code-changes.rs` now matches its exclusion list against paths relative to the detected Rust package root, so in the multi-language (`rust/Cargo.toml`) layout an `examples/`- or `changelog.d/`-only pull request is no longer reported as a code change (#139).
- Changes belonging to another language of a multi-language repository (for example `python/pyproject.toml`) are no longer reported as Rust changes; shared paths (`.github/`, `scripts/`, repository-root files) stay in scope.

## [0.19.29] - 2026-08-20

### Added
- `scripts/run-with-budget-warning.sh`: runs a command under an explicit execution budget, warns at 70% of it, terminates the command's whole process group when it expires, and exits `124` with a `::error` annotation naming the budget and the overrun.
- CI invariant tests (`tests/unit/ci-cd/issue_135.rs`): every workflow job declares `timeout-minutes`, and every step budget stays at or below 70% of its job's cap.

### Fixed
- A step that outran its job's `timeout-minutes` was reported by GitHub as `cancelled` rather than `failed`, which `check-pipeline-status.sh` only escalated to an error on `main`. The long steps in `release.yml` (`test`, `coverage`, `fresh-merge`) now own a deadline that expires before the job cap, so a real timeout fails the job on any ref.
- The non-default-ref warning in `check-pipeline-status.sh` now names the `has exceeded the maximum execution time` annotation, so a genuine timeout on a pull request is searchable instead of silent.

## [0.19.28] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed
- `scripts/check-web-archive.mjs` no longer reports `all_archived=true` when lychee's only errors are non-HTTP links. Missing local files and unresolvable root-relative links (`[ERROR] <file:///...>`, `[ERROR] <error:>`) are now parsed, annotated as errors, and make the script exit non-zero instead of being silently dropped ([#136](https://github.com/link-foundation/rust-ai-driven-development-pipeline-template/issues/136)).

### Added
- Regression tests for the lychee report parser (`scripts/check-web-archive.test.mjs`) backed by a captured lychee report fixture (`scripts/fixtures/lychee-report.md`).

## [0.19.27] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- Audit the committed `Cargo.lock` for RustSec advisories on pull requests, pushes to `main`, and weekly scheduled security runs.

## [0.19.26] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- Suppress the reviewed Node.js `DEP0005` warning emitted by `actions/download-artifact@v8` without hiding unrelated warnings.

## [0.19.25] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- Prevent the Web Archive helper from reporting successful Lychee redirects as broken links.

### Fixed

- Fail broken-link checks for dead live URLs even when Wayback snapshots are available.

## [0.19.24] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed
- Publish native `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` Docker images without delaying the GitHub Release on registry work.

## [0.19.23] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- Reuse the GitHub Actions layer cache for release Docker builds and allow enough time for cold-cache releases to finish.

## [0.19.22] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Add an opt-in six-platform desktop release workflow with checksums, build provenance, PR dry runs, and a GitHub Pages `/download` page.

## [0.19.21] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- Surface timed-out jobs as pipeline failures on main instead of leaving silently cancelled workflow runs.

## [0.19.20] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Check Markdown and HTML links in CI, with Wayback Machine fallback guidance.

## [0.19.19] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Add CodeQL analysis for Rust and GitHub Actions workflows, plus dependency review for pull requests.

## [0.19.18] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed
- Remove the unsupported `queue` key from release workflow concurrency blocks so the workflow passes GitHub Actions schema validation

## [0.19.17] - 2026-08-01

### Security
- Prevent workflow-dispatch inputs from being interpolated directly into release shell scripts

### Fixed
- Cancel superseded read-only CI jobs independently while preserving all queued write-capable jobs and running them one at a time

## [0.19.16] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- Keep excluded-only changes from activating change-gated CI jobs on pull requests and pushes.

## [0.19.15] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed
- File-size warning annotations are now emitted only for files changed by the current pull request or push, so unchanged files stop repeating the same warning on every run. The 1000-line hard limit and the full baseline report remain repository-wide.

## [0.19.14] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed
- CI: replaced the self-contradictory `always() && !cancelled()` job guards in `.github/workflows/release.yml` with `!cancelled()` alone, so cancelling a run actually stops the dependent jobs

### Added
- CI: `Docker Image Build Check` pull-request job that builds the image without pushing (works for fork pull requests), so a Dockerfile regression fails the PR instead of producing a half-finished release
- CI: `Fresh Merge Simulation` pull-request job and `scripts/simulate-fresh-merge.sh`, which merges the PR head into the current base tip and re-runs fmt/clippy/test to catch semantic merge conflicts
- CI: `Secrets Scan` job running `secretlint` with the recommended rule preset

## [0.19.13] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed
- Gate `cargo doc --no-deps --all-features` with `RUSTDOCFLAGS: -D warnings` in the lint job so rustdoc-only lints fail before release, and keep the same fail-closed flags in the `deploy-docs` build step (#96)

## [0.19.12] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed
- Release workflow no longer runs bare `cargo install rust-script`. All nine call sites now use `scripts/install-rust-script.sh`, which short-circuits when `rust-script` is already present, installs with `--locked` for reproducible builds, and retries up to 3 times with backoff so a transient crates.io failure does not fail a release.

## [0.19.11] - 2026-07-20

### Security
- Added a top-level `permissions: contents: read` block to `.github/workflows/release.yml` so jobs no longer inherit the repository's default `GITHUB_TOKEN` scope; jobs that need write access already escalate explicitly

## [0.19.10] - 2026-07-20

### Changed
- Bumped `codecov/codecov-action` from v5 to v7 in CI workflows

## [0.19.9] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- `version-and-commit.rs` no longer reports "Local branch is behind remote" when the branch merely differs from (or is ahead of) `origin/<branch>`. It now counts `HEAD..origin/<branch>` and rebases only when actually behind, logging the real commit count (#95).

## [0.19.8] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed
- `scripts/version-and-commit.rs`: create the release tag after the push-retry loop succeeds, so a `pull --rebase` retry can no longer leave the tag on an orphaned pre-rebase commit (#94)

## [0.19.7] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- Suppress Git's default initial branch warning during release workflow checkout.

## [0.19.6] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- Avoid false-positive Rust CI failures by scoping Cargo cache keys per job, skipping `target` cache uploads on Windows tests, giving the test matrix cleanup headroom, and only running Codecov uploads when `CODECOV_TOKEN` is configured.

## [0.19.5] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- Retry the crate-size `cargo package` step before reporting package-size guard failure so transient registry downloads do not fail releases immediately.

## [0.19.4] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- Use static versioned Shields.io docs.rs badges in GitHub release notes so historical releases do not show live docs.rs build states.
- Update the README docs.rs badge to use the Shields.io docs.rs endpoint.

## [0.19.3] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- Hardened Cargo registry downloads in the CI/CD workflow with additional retries and disabled HTTP multiplexing to reduce transient HTTP/2 framing failures.

## [0.19.2] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- Detect real merge commits pushed to `main` with a first-parent diff so earlier code commits in the merged branch still trigger CI.

## [0.19.1] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- Generate a GitHub Pages root redirect for deployed rustdoc output so the documentation site root no longer 404s.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- Auto-detect single-language versus `rust/` multi-language release layout for Rust releases, using `rust_v` tags and `[Rust]` titles only in multi-language monorepos while adding exact-version crates.io badges to GitHub release notes.

## [0.18.5] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- Added a CI guard that fails binary Rust crates when `Cargo.lock` is missing from the committed repository state, preventing empty-hash cargo cache keys and fresh dependency re-resolution drift.

## [0.18.4] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- Add a post-publish crates.io smoke test to the release workflow. The new `scripts/smoke-test-published-crate.rs` installs the exact published crate into a throwaway root, runs detected CLI binaries with captured `--help` output, and compiles a fresh dependent crate against the published library before Docker Hub or GitHub release artifacts are created.

### Fixed
- Harden the template CLI stdout path so `BrokenPipe` from a closed downstream reader is treated as a clean exit instead of a panic.

## [0.18.3] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- Skipped the full test matrix on pull requests that only change non-code files.

## [0.18.2] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- Harden the Docker publish step against transient Docker Hub registry outages. `release.yml` now boots buildx via the new `setup-buildx-resilient` composite action, which pre-pulls the pinned `moby/buildkit:buildx-stable-1` image with retries and a `mirror.gcr.io` pull-through fallback before the docker-container driver boots, so a registry blip no longer fails the release ([#69](https://github.com/link-foundation/rust-ai-driven-development-pipeline-template/issues/69)).

## [0.18.1] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- `version-and-commit.rs`: rebase onto the remote branch **before** staging the version bump. `git rebase` refuses to run with a dirty index, so staging first caused the release job to abort with "cannot rebase: Your index contains uncommitted changes" whenever a concurrent release advanced the remote branch. The fetch + rebase now runs while the working tree is clean, matching the JavaScript template's ordering (#67).

## [0.18.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- Changeset-style fragment format with frontmatter for specifying version bump type
- New `get-bump-type.mjs` script to automatically determine version bump from fragments
- Automatic version bumping on merge to main based on changelog fragments
- Detailed documentation for the changelog fragment system in `changelog.d/README.md`

### Changed
- Updated `collect-changelog.mjs` to strip frontmatter when collecting fragments
- Updated `version-and-commit.mjs` to handle frontmatter in fragments
- Enhanced release workflow to automatically determine bump type from changesets

### Changed
- Add `detect-changes` job with cross-platform `detect-code-changes.mjs` script
- Make lint job independent of changelog check (runs based on file changes only)
- Allow docs-only PRs without changelog fragment requirement
- Handle changelog check 'skipped' state in dependent jobs
- Exclude `changelog.d/`, `docs/`, `experiments/`, `examples/` folders and markdown files from code changes detection

### Fixed
- Fixed README.md to correctly reference Node.js scripts (`.mjs`) instead of Python scripts (`.py`)
- Updated project structure in README.md to match actual script files in `scripts/` directory
- Fixed example code in README.md that had invalid Rust with two `main` functions

### Added

- Added crates.io publishing support to CI/CD workflow
- Added `release_mode` input with "instant" and "changelog-pr" options for manual releases
- Added `--tag-prefix` and `--crates-io-url` options to create-github-release.mjs script
- Added comprehensive case study documentation for Issue #11 in docs/case-studies/issue-11/

### Changed

- Changed changelog fragment check from warning to error (exit 1) to enforce changelog requirements
- Updated job conditions with `always() && !cancelled()` to fix workflow_dispatch job skipping issue
- Renamed manual-release job to "Instant Release" for clarity

### Fixed

- Fixed deprecated `::set-output` GitHub Actions command in version-and-commit.mjs
- Fixed workflow_dispatch triggering issues where lint/build/release jobs were incorrectly skipped

### Fixed

- Fixed changelog fragment check to validate that a fragment is **added in the PR diff** rather than just checking if any fragments exist in the directory. This prevents the check from incorrectly passing when there are leftover fragments from previous PRs that haven't been released yet.

### Changed

- Converted shell scripts in `release.yml` to cross-platform `.mjs` scripts for improved portability and performance:
  - `check-changelog-fragment.mjs` - validates changelog fragment is added in PR diff
  - `git-config.mjs` - configures git user for CI/CD
  - `check-release-needed.mjs` - checks if release is needed
  - `publish-crate.mjs` - publishes package to crates.io
  - `create-changelog-fragment.mjs` - creates changelog fragments for manual releases
  - `get-version.mjs` - gets current version from Cargo.toml

### Added

- Added `check-version-modification.mjs` script to detect manual version changes in Cargo.toml
- Added `version-check` job to CI/CD workflow that runs on pull requests
- Added skip logic for automated release branches (changelog-manual-release-*, changeset-release/*, release/*, automated-release/*)

### Changed

- Version modifications in Cargo.toml are now blocked in pull requests to enforce automated release pipeline

### Added

- Added support for `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` as alternative to `CARGO_TOKEN` for crates.io publishing
- Added case study documentation for Issue #17 (yargs reserved word and dual token support)

### Changed

- Updated workflow to use fallback logic: `${{ secrets.CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN || secrets.CARGO_TOKEN }}`
- Improved publish-crate.mjs to check both `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` and `CARGO_TOKEN` environment variables
- Added warning message when neither token is set

### Added
- New `scripts/rust-paths.mjs` utility for automatic Rust package root detection
- Support for both single-language and multi-language repository structures in all CI/CD scripts
- Configuration options via `--rust-root` CLI argument and `RUST_ROOT` environment variable
- Comprehensive case study documentation in `docs/case-studies/issue-19/`

### Changed
- Updated all release scripts to use the new path detection utility:
  - `scripts/bump-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/check-release-needed.mjs`
  - `scripts/collect-changelog.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-bump-type.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/publish-crate.mjs`
  - `scripts/version-and-commit.mjs`

### Changed

- **check-release-needed.mjs**: Now checks crates.io API directly instead of git tags to determine if a version is already released. This prevents false positives where git tags exist but the package was never actually published to crates.io.

### Added

- **CI/CD Troubleshooting Guide**: New documentation at `docs/ci-cd/troubleshooting.md` covering common issues like skipped jobs, false positive version checks, publishing failures, and secret configuration.

- **Enhanced Error Handling in publish-crate.mjs**: Added specific detection and helpful error messages for authentication failures, including guidance on secret configuration and workflow setup.

- **Case Study Documentation**: Added comprehensive case study at `docs/case-studies/issue-21/` analyzing CI/CD failures from browser-commander repository (issues #27, #29, #31, #33) with timeline, root causes, and lessons learned.

### Fixed

- **Prevent False Positive Version Checks**: The release workflow now correctly identifies unpublished versions by checking crates.io instead of relying on git tags, which can exist without the package being published.

### Changed

- Translated all CI/CD scripts from JavaScript (.mjs) to Rust (.rs) using rust-script
- Scripts now use native Rust with rust-script for execution in shell
- Removed Node.js dependency from CI/CD pipeline
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use rust-script instead of node
- Updated README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with new script references

### Added

- Cache `restore-keys` for partial cache hits across all workflow jobs
- Explicit `token` parameter in checkout for release jobs
- Code coverage job with `cargo-llvm-cov` and Codecov integration
- Codecov badge in README.md
- Pre-release version support (e.g., `0.1.0-beta.1`) in version parsing
- `--release-label` parameter for multi-language release disambiguation
- `ensure_version_exceeds_published()` logic to prevent publishing duplicate versions
- `get_max_published_version()` to query highest non-yanked version from crates.io
- `max_published_version` output from check-release-needed for downstream use
- Version fallback logic in auto-release Create GitHub Release step

### Changed

- Updated `actions/checkout` from v4 to v6
- Updated `actions/cache` from v4 to v5
- Updated `peter-evans/create-pull-request` from v7 to v8
- Made `publish-crate.rs` fail (exit 1) when version already exists on crates.io
- Improved `create-github-release.rs` to check combined stdout+stderr and detect "Validation Failed"

### Fixed

- Fix publish steps overriding workflow-level CARGO_TOKEN fallback, breaking CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN-only configurations (#32)
- Fix non-fast-forward push failures in multi-workflow repos by adding fetch/rebase and push retry logic (#31)
- Add mono-repo path support to check-changelog-fragment.rs, check-version-modification.rs, and create-changelog-fragment.rs
- Add `!cancelled()` guard to test job condition to respect workflow cancellation

### Fixed

- Fixed `version-and-commit.rs` to check crates.io instead of git tags for determining if a version is already released
- This prevents the release pipeline from getting stuck when git tags exist without corresponding crates.io publication

### Added

- Added `--tag-prefix` support to `version-and-commit.rs` for multi-language repository compatibility
- Added crates.io and docs.rs badges to README.md
- Added automatic crates.io and docs.rs badge injection in GitHub release notes
- Added documentation deployment job to CI/CD pipeline (deploys to GitHub Pages after release)
- Added case study documentation for issue #25

### Fixed
- Fixed unsupported look-ahead regex in `create-github-release.rs` that caused a panic when parsing CHANGELOG.md. Replaced with a two-step approach using only features supported by Rust's `regex` crate.

### Changed
- Restructured example application as a simple CLI sum calculator using `lino-arguments`
- Renamed default package to `example-sum-package-name` with Unlicense license
- Reorganized test structure: `tests/unit/sum.rs`, `tests/integration/sum.rs`, `tests/unit/ci-cd/`
- Converted experiment scripts into proper unit tests in `tests/unit/ci-cd/changelog_parsing.rs`
- Added CI/CD skip logic for template default package name `example-sum-package-name`
- Updated README.md badges and documentation

### Fixed

- Change detection script now uses per-commit diff instead of full PR diff, so commits touching only non-code files correctly skip CI jobs even when earlier commits in the same PR changed code files

### Fixed
- Make release scripts resolve the publishable crate manifest when the repository root uses a Cargo workspace manifest.

### Fixed
- Decoupled GitHub Pages documentation deployment from package release publication and fixed release-script warning failures under `RUSTFLAGS=-Dwarnings`.

### Changed
- Added explicit GitHub Actions job timeouts and documented Rust test timeout guidance.

### Fixed
- Added a non-blocking warning threshold to the Rust file-size check so near-limit files are surfaced before concurrent PR merges can exceed the hard limit.

### Fixed
- Made `create-github-release.rs` build GitHub release titles as `[Language] X.Y.Z` instead of reusing the tag prefix.

### Added
- Added optional Docker Hub image publishing tied to Rust crate releases, including crates.io visibility waiting, version/latest image tags, and Docker Hub badges in GitHub release notes.

### Changed
- Release completeness checks now self-heal when crates.io exists but configured Docker Hub or GitHub release artifacts are missing.

### Fixed
- Switched documentation deployment to the official GitHub Pages artifact workflow so repositories using GitHub Actions as their Pages source do not get false-positive branch-push deploys.

### Added
- Documented the one-time `Settings → Pages → Source = GitHub Actions` prerequisite for the `deploy-docs` job in `README.md` and as a comment above the `deploy-docs` job in `release.yml`, so downstream template users hit a documented setup step instead of a `Get Pages site failed` error on the first deploy.

### Added
- Tracking case study at `docs/case-studies/issue-52/` registering the `browser-commander` + Playwright preview-regeneration pattern from [`konard/vk-bot-desktop#52`](https://github.com/konard/vk-bot-desktop/pull/52), with an activation checklist for when an example-app surface lands in this template. Documentation only — no workflow, script, or runtime code changes. Primary upstream tracking issue: [`link-foundation/js-ai-driven-development-pipeline-template#62`](https://github.com/link-foundation/js-ai-driven-development-pipeline-template/issues/62).

### Fixed
- Release automation now keeps the workspace package entry in `Cargo.lock` synchronized when `scripts/version-and-commit.rs` bumps `Cargo.toml`, preventing stale lock-file version diffs in later pull requests.

### Fixed
- `scripts/publish-crate.rs` now treats crates.io HTTP 429 throttle responses ("You have published too many versions of this crate in the last 24 hours") as a deferred `publish_result=rate_limited` outcome (it writes the output, prints an explanatory banner and exits successfully) instead of a hard CI failure reported as a generic `failed` ("Failed to publish for unknown reason"). Authentication, already-published and unknown failures still exit non-zero. Failed-publish classification is consolidated through a single `classify_failure` function and `FailureKind` enum (with an `is_deferred` predicate), covered by unit tests runnable via `rust-script --test scripts/publish-crate.rs`.
- The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) now gates crate-availability waiting, Docker Hub publishing and GitHub release creation on either an already-published crate or `publish_result=success`, so a deferred (rate-limited) crate upload no longer produces partial downstream release artifacts and the same version is retried automatically on the next push to `main`.

### Fixed
- Fixed reversed `cancel-in-progress` concurrency condition in `release.yml` that cancelled in-flight releases on `main` and never superseded older PR runs. The condition now uses `!=` so `main` releases run to completion while newer PR pushes cancel stale runs.

### Added
- Added a `scripts/check-crate-size.rs` guard that builds the `.crate` archive and fails the release before publishing when it exceeds the crates.io 10 MiB upload limit. The check runs in the build job and before publishing in both the auto-release and manual-release jobs.

### Changed
- Added a narrow `include` allowlist to `Cargo.toml` so docs, case studies, generated CI artifacts, changelog fragments, scripts, and experiments no longer inflate the published release archive.

### Fixed
- Prevented GitHub release creation from treating generic API validation failures as existing releases, and capped oversized release notes with a link to the full tagged changelog.

### Fixed
- Removed consumed changelog fragments from automated release commits so stale fragments do not trigger repeated releases.

- Detailed documentation for the changelog fragment system in `changelog.d/README.md`

### Changed
- Updated `collect-changelog.mjs` to strip frontmatter when collecting fragments
- Updated `version-and-commit.mjs` to handle frontmatter in fragments
- Enhanced release workflow to automatically determine bump type from changesets

### Changed
- Add `detect-changes` job with cross-platform `detect-code-changes.mjs` script
- Make lint job independent of changelog check (runs based on file changes only)
- Allow docs-only PRs without changelog fragment requirement
- Handle changelog check 'skipped' state in dependent jobs
- Exclude `changelog.d/`, `docs/`, `experiments/`, `examples/` folders and markdown files from code changes detection

### Fixed
- Fixed README.md to correctly reference Node.js scripts (`.mjs`) instead of Python scripts (`.py`)
- Updated project structure in README.md to match actual script files in `scripts/` directory
- Fixed example code in README.md that had invalid Rust with two `main` functions

### Added

- Added crates.io publishing support to CI/CD workflow
- Added `release_mode` input with "instant" and "changelog-pr" options for manual releases
- Added `--tag-prefix` and `--crates-io-url` options to create-github-release.mjs script
- Added comprehensive case study documentation for Issue #11 in docs/case-studies/issue-11/

### Changed

- Changed changelog fragment check from warning to error (exit 1) to enforce changelog requirements
- Updated job conditions with `always() && !cancelled()` to fix workflow_dispatch job skipping issue
- Renamed manual-release job to "Instant Release" for clarity

### Fixed

- Fixed deprecated `::set-output` GitHub Actions command in version-and-commit.mjs
- Fixed workflow_dispatch triggering issues where lint/build/release jobs were incorrectly skipped

### Fixed

- Fixed changelog fragment check to validate that a fragment is **added in the PR diff** rather than just checking if any fragments exist in the directory. This prevents the check from incorrectly passing when there are leftover fragments from previous PRs that haven't been released yet.

### Changed

- Converted shell scripts in `release.yml` to cross-platform `.mjs` scripts for improved portability and performance:
  - `check-changelog-fragment.mjs` - validates changelog fragment is added in PR diff
  - `git-config.mjs` - configures git user for CI/CD
  - `check-release-needed.mjs` - checks if release is needed
  - `publish-crate.mjs` - publishes package to crates.io
  - `create-changelog-fragment.mjs` - creates changelog fragments for manual releases
  - `get-version.mjs` - gets current version from Cargo.toml

### Added

- Added `check-version-modification.mjs` script to detect manual version changes in Cargo.toml
- Added `version-check` job to CI/CD workflow that runs on pull requests
- Added skip logic for automated release branches (changelog-manual-release-*, changeset-release/*, release/*, automated-release/*)

### Changed

- Version modifications in Cargo.toml are now blocked in pull requests to enforce automated release pipeline

### Added

- Added support for `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` as alternative to `CARGO_TOKEN` for crates.io publishing
- Added case study documentation for Issue #17 (yargs reserved word and dual token support)

### Changed

- Updated workflow to use fallback logic: `${{ secrets.CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN || secrets.CARGO_TOKEN }}`
- Improved publish-crate.mjs to check both `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` and `CARGO_TOKEN` environment variables
- Added warning message when neither token is set

### Added
- New `scripts/rust-paths.mjs` utility for automatic Rust package root detection
- Support for both single-language and multi-language repository structures in all CI/CD scripts
- Configuration options via `--rust-root` CLI argument and `RUST_ROOT` environment variable
- Comprehensive case study documentation in `docs/case-studies/issue-19/`

### Changed
- Updated all release scripts to use the new path detection utility:
  - `scripts/bump-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/check-release-needed.mjs`
  - `scripts/collect-changelog.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-bump-type.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/publish-crate.mjs`
  - `scripts/version-and-commit.mjs`

### Changed

- **check-release-needed.mjs**: Now checks crates.io API directly instead of git tags to determine if a version is already released. This prevents false positives where git tags exist but the package was never actually published to crates.io.

### Added

- **CI/CD Troubleshooting Guide**: New documentation at `docs/ci-cd/troubleshooting.md` covering common issues like skipped jobs, false positive version checks, publishing failures, and secret configuration.

- **Enhanced Error Handling in publish-crate.mjs**: Added specific detection and helpful error messages for authentication failures, including guidance on secret configuration and workflow setup.

- **Case Study Documentation**: Added comprehensive case study at `docs/case-studies/issue-21/` analyzing CI/CD failures from browser-commander repository (issues #27, #29, #31, #33) with timeline, root causes, and lessons learned.

### Fixed

- **Prevent False Positive Version Checks**: The release workflow now correctly identifies unpublished versions by checking crates.io instead of relying on git tags, which can exist without the package being published.

### Changed

- Translated all CI/CD scripts from JavaScript (.mjs) to Rust (.rs) using rust-script
- Scripts now use native Rust with rust-script for execution in shell
- Removed Node.js dependency from CI/CD pipeline
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use rust-script instead of node
- Updated README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with new script references

### Added

- Cache `restore-keys` for partial cache hits across all workflow jobs
- Explicit `token` parameter in checkout for release jobs
- Code coverage job with `cargo-llvm-cov` and Codecov integration
- Codecov badge in README.md
- Pre-release version support (e.g., `0.1.0-beta.1`) in version parsing
- `--release-label` parameter for multi-language release disambiguation
- `ensure_version_exceeds_published()` logic to prevent publishing duplicate versions
- `get_max_published_version()` to query highest non-yanked version from crates.io
- `max_published_version` output from check-release-needed for downstream use
- Version fallback logic in auto-release Create GitHub Release step

### Changed

- Updated `actions/checkout` from v4 to v6
- Updated `actions/cache` from v4 to v5
- Updated `peter-evans/create-pull-request` from v7 to v8
- Made `publish-crate.rs` fail (exit 1) when version already exists on crates.io
- Improved `create-github-release.rs` to check combined stdout+stderr and detect "Validation Failed"

### Fixed

- Fix publish steps overriding workflow-level CARGO_TOKEN fallback, breaking CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN-only configurations (#32)
- Fix non-fast-forward push failures in multi-workflow repos by adding fetch/rebase and push retry logic (#31)
- Add mono-repo path support to check-changelog-fragment.rs, check-version-modification.rs, and create-changelog-fragment.rs
- Add `!cancelled()` guard to test job condition to respect workflow cancellation

### Fixed

- Fixed `version-and-commit.rs` to check crates.io instead of git tags for determining if a version is already released
- This prevents the release pipeline from getting stuck when git tags exist without corresponding crates.io publication

### Added

- Added `--tag-prefix` support to `version-and-commit.rs` for multi-language repository compatibility
- Added crates.io and docs.rs badges to README.md
- Added automatic crates.io and docs.rs badge injection in GitHub release notes
- Added documentation deployment job to CI/CD pipeline (deploys to GitHub Pages after release)
- Added case study documentation for issue #25

### Fixed
- Fixed unsupported look-ahead regex in `create-github-release.rs` that caused a panic when parsing CHANGELOG.md. Replaced with a two-step approach using only features supported by Rust's `regex` crate.

### Changed
- Restructured example application as a simple CLI sum calculator using `lino-arguments`
- Renamed default package to `example-sum-package-name` with Unlicense license

- Added `release_mode` input with "instant" and "changelog-pr" options for manual releases
- Added `--tag-prefix` and `--crates-io-url` options to create-github-release.mjs script
- Added comprehensive case study documentation for Issue #11 in docs/case-studies/issue-11/

### Changed

- Changed changelog fragment check from warning to error (exit 1) to enforce changelog requirements
- Updated job conditions with `always() && !cancelled()` to fix workflow_dispatch job skipping issue
- Renamed manual-release job to "Instant Release" for clarity

### Fixed

- Fixed deprecated `::set-output` GitHub Actions command in version-and-commit.mjs
- Fixed workflow_dispatch triggering issues where lint/build/release jobs were incorrectly skipped

### Fixed

- Fixed changelog fragment check to validate that a fragment is **added in the PR diff** rather than just checking if any fragments exist in the directory. This prevents the check from incorrectly passing when there are leftover fragments from previous PRs that haven't been released yet.

### Changed

- Converted shell scripts in `release.yml` to cross-platform `.mjs` scripts for improved portability and performance:
  - `check-changelog-fragment.mjs` - validates changelog fragment is added in PR diff
  - `git-config.mjs` - configures git user for CI/CD
  - `check-release-needed.mjs` - checks if release is needed
  - `publish-crate.mjs` - publishes package to crates.io
  - `create-changelog-fragment.mjs` - creates changelog fragments for manual releases
  - `get-version.mjs` - gets current version from Cargo.toml

### Added

- Added `check-version-modification.mjs` script to detect manual version changes in Cargo.toml
- Added `version-check` job to CI/CD workflow that runs on pull requests
- Added skip logic for automated release branches (changelog-manual-release-*, changeset-release/*, release/*, automated-release/*)

### Changed

- Version modifications in Cargo.toml are now blocked in pull requests to enforce automated release pipeline

### Added

- Added support for `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` as alternative to `CARGO_TOKEN` for crates.io publishing
- Added case study documentation for Issue #17 (yargs reserved word and dual token support)

### Changed

- Updated workflow to use fallback logic: `${{ secrets.CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN || secrets.CARGO_TOKEN }}`
- Improved publish-crate.mjs to check both `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` and `CARGO_TOKEN` environment variables
- Added warning message when neither token is set

### Added
- New `scripts/rust-paths.mjs` utility for automatic Rust package root detection
- Support for both single-language and multi-language repository structures in all CI/CD scripts
- Configuration options via `--rust-root` CLI argument and `RUST_ROOT` environment variable
- Comprehensive case study documentation in `docs/case-studies/issue-19/`

### Changed
- Updated all release scripts to use the new path detection utility:
  - `scripts/bump-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/check-release-needed.mjs`
  - `scripts/collect-changelog.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-bump-type.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/publish-crate.mjs`
  - `scripts/version-and-commit.mjs`

### Changed

- **check-release-needed.mjs**: Now checks crates.io API directly instead of git tags to determine if a version is already released. This prevents false positives where git tags exist but the package was never actually published to crates.io.

### Added

- **CI/CD Troubleshooting Guide**: New documentation at `docs/ci-cd/troubleshooting.md` covering common issues like skipped jobs, false positive version checks, publishing failures, and secret configuration.

- **Enhanced Error Handling in publish-crate.mjs**: Added specific detection and helpful error messages for authentication failures, including guidance on secret configuration and workflow setup.

- **Case Study Documentation**: Added comprehensive case study at `docs/case-studies/issue-21/` analyzing CI/CD failures from browser-commander repository (issues #27, #29, #31, #33) with timeline, root causes, and lessons learned.

### Fixed

- **Prevent False Positive Version Checks**: The release workflow now correctly identifies unpublished versions by checking crates.io instead of relying on git tags, which can exist without the package being published.

### Changed

- Translated all CI/CD scripts from JavaScript (.mjs) to Rust (.rs) using rust-script
- Scripts now use native Rust with rust-script for execution in shell
- Removed Node.js dependency from CI/CD pipeline
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use rust-script instead of node
- Updated README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with new script references

### Added

- Cache `restore-keys` for partial cache hits across all workflow jobs
- Explicit `token` parameter in checkout for release jobs
- Code coverage job with `cargo-llvm-cov` and Codecov integration
- Codecov badge in README.md
- Pre-release version support (e.g., `0.1.0-beta.1`) in version parsing
- `--release-label` parameter for multi-language release disambiguation
- `ensure_version_exceeds_published()` logic to prevent publishing duplicate versions
- `get_max_published_version()` to query highest non-yanked version from crates.io
- `max_published_version` output from check-release-needed for downstream use
- Version fallback logic in auto-release Create GitHub Release step

### Changed

- Updated `actions/checkout` from v4 to v6
- Updated `actions/cache` from v4 to v5
- Updated `peter-evans/create-pull-request` from v7 to v8
- Made `publish-crate.rs` fail (exit 1) when version already exists on crates.io
- Improved `create-github-release.rs` to check combined stdout+stderr and detect "Validation Failed"

### Fixed

- Fix publish steps overriding workflow-level CARGO_TOKEN fallback, breaking CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN-only configurations (#32)
- Fix non-fast-forward push failures in multi-workflow repos by adding fetch/rebase and push retry logic (#31)
- Add mono-repo path support to check-changelog-fragment.rs, check-version-modification.rs, and create-changelog-fragment.rs
- Add `!cancelled()` guard to test job condition to respect workflow cancellation

### Fixed

- Fixed `version-and-commit.rs` to check crates.io instead of git tags for determining if a version is already released
- This prevents the release pipeline from getting stuck when git tags exist without corresponding crates.io publication

### Added

- Added `--tag-prefix` support to `version-and-commit.rs` for multi-language repository compatibility
- Added crates.io and docs.rs badges to README.md
- Added automatic crates.io and docs.rs badge injection in GitHub release notes
- Added documentation deployment job to CI/CD pipeline (deploys to GitHub Pages after release)
- Added case study documentation for issue #25

### Fixed
- Fixed unsupported look-ahead regex in `create-github-release.rs` that caused a panic when parsing CHANGELOG.md. Replaced with a two-step approach using only features supported by Rust's `regex` crate.

### Changed
- Restructured example application as a simple CLI sum calculator using `lino-arguments`
- Renamed default package to `example-sum-package-name` with Unlicense license
- Reorganized test structure: `tests/unit/sum.rs`, `tests/integration/sum.rs`, `tests/unit/ci-cd/`
- Converted experiment scripts into proper unit tests in `tests/unit/ci-cd/changelog_parsing.rs`
- Added CI/CD skip logic for template default package name `example-sum-package-name`
- Updated README.md badges and documentation

### Fixed

- Change detection script now uses per-commit diff instead of full PR diff, so commits touching only non-code files correctly skip CI jobs even when earlier commits in the same PR changed code files

### Fixed
- Make release scripts resolve the publishable crate manifest when the repository root uses a Cargo workspace manifest.

### Fixed
- Decoupled GitHub Pages documentation deployment from package release publication and fixed release-script warning failures under `RUSTFLAGS=-Dwarnings`.

### Changed
- Added explicit GitHub Actions job timeouts and documented Rust test timeout guidance.

### Fixed
- Added a non-blocking warning threshold to the Rust file-size check so near-limit files are surfaced before concurrent PR merges can exceed the hard limit.

### Fixed
- Made `create-github-release.rs` build GitHub release titles as `[Language] X.Y.Z` instead of reusing the tag prefix.

### Added
- Added optional Docker Hub image publishing tied to Rust crate releases, including crates.io visibility waiting, version/latest image tags, and Docker Hub badges in GitHub release notes.

### Changed
- Release completeness checks now self-heal when crates.io exists but configured Docker Hub or GitHub release artifacts are missing.

### Fixed
- Switched documentation deployment to the official GitHub Pages artifact workflow so repositories using GitHub Actions as their Pages source do not get false-positive branch-push deploys.

### Added
- Documented the one-time `Settings → Pages → Source = GitHub Actions` prerequisite for the `deploy-docs` job in `README.md` and as a comment above the `deploy-docs` job in `release.yml`, so downstream template users hit a documented setup step instead of a `Get Pages site failed` error on the first deploy.

### Added
- Tracking case study at `docs/case-studies/issue-52/` registering the `browser-commander` + Playwright preview-regeneration pattern from [`konard/vk-bot-desktop#52`](https://github.com/konard/vk-bot-desktop/pull/52), with an activation checklist for when an example-app surface lands in this template. Documentation only — no workflow, script, or runtime code changes. Primary upstream tracking issue: [`link-foundation/js-ai-driven-development-pipeline-template#62`](https://github.com/link-foundation/js-ai-driven-development-pipeline-template/issues/62).

### Fixed
- Release automation now keeps the workspace package entry in `Cargo.lock` synchronized when `scripts/version-and-commit.rs` bumps `Cargo.toml`, preventing stale lock-file version diffs in later pull requests.

- Add `detect-changes` job with cross-platform `detect-code-changes.mjs` script
- Make lint job independent of changelog check (runs based on file changes only)
- Allow docs-only PRs without changelog fragment requirement
- Handle changelog check 'skipped' state in dependent jobs
- Exclude `changelog.d/`, `docs/`, `experiments/`, `examples/` folders and markdown files from code changes detection

### Fixed
- Fixed README.md to correctly reference Node.js scripts (`.mjs`) instead of Python scripts (`.py`)
- Updated project structure in README.md to match actual script files in `scripts/` directory
- Fixed example code in README.md that had invalid Rust with two `main` functions

### Added

- Added crates.io publishing support to CI/CD workflow
- Added `release_mode` input with "instant" and "changelog-pr" options for manual releases
- Added `--tag-prefix` and `--crates-io-url` options to create-github-release.mjs script
- Added comprehensive case study documentation for Issue #11 in docs/case-studies/issue-11/

### Changed

- Changed changelog fragment check from warning to error (exit 1) to enforce changelog requirements
- Updated job conditions with `always() && !cancelled()` to fix workflow_dispatch job skipping issue
- Renamed manual-release job to "Instant Release" for clarity

### Fixed

- Fixed deprecated `::set-output` GitHub Actions command in version-and-commit.mjs
- Fixed workflow_dispatch triggering issues where lint/build/release jobs were incorrectly skipped

### Fixed

- Fixed changelog fragment check to validate that a fragment is **added in the PR diff** rather than just checking if any fragments exist in the directory. This prevents the check from incorrectly passing when there are leftover fragments from previous PRs that haven't been released yet.

### Changed

- Converted shell scripts in `release.yml` to cross-platform `.mjs` scripts for improved portability and performance:
  - `check-changelog-fragment.mjs` - validates changelog fragment is added in PR diff
  - `git-config.mjs` - configures git user for CI/CD
  - `check-release-needed.mjs` - checks if release is needed
  - `publish-crate.mjs` - publishes package to crates.io
  - `create-changelog-fragment.mjs` - creates changelog fragments for manual releases
  - `get-version.mjs` - gets current version from Cargo.toml

### Added

- Added `check-version-modification.mjs` script to detect manual version changes in Cargo.toml
- Added `version-check` job to CI/CD workflow that runs on pull requests
- Added skip logic for automated release branches (changelog-manual-release-*, changeset-release/*, release/*, automated-release/*)

### Changed

- Version modifications in Cargo.toml are now blocked in pull requests to enforce automated release pipeline

### Added

- Added support for `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` as alternative to `CARGO_TOKEN` for crates.io publishing
- Added case study documentation for Issue #17 (yargs reserved word and dual token support)

### Changed

- Updated workflow to use fallback logic: `${{ secrets.CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN || secrets.CARGO_TOKEN }}`
- Improved publish-crate.mjs to check both `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` and `CARGO_TOKEN` environment variables
- Added warning message when neither token is set

### Added
- New `scripts/rust-paths.mjs` utility for automatic Rust package root detection
- Support for both single-language and multi-language repository structures in all CI/CD scripts
- Configuration options via `--rust-root` CLI argument and `RUST_ROOT` environment variable
- Comprehensive case study documentation in `docs/case-studies/issue-19/`

### Changed
- Updated all release scripts to use the new path detection utility:
  - `scripts/bump-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/check-release-needed.mjs`
  - `scripts/collect-changelog.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-bump-type.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/publish-crate.mjs`
  - `scripts/version-and-commit.mjs`

### Changed

- **check-release-needed.mjs**: Now checks crates.io API directly instead of git tags to determine if a version is already released. This prevents false positives where git tags exist but the package was never actually published to crates.io.

### Added

- **CI/CD Troubleshooting Guide**: New documentation at `docs/ci-cd/troubleshooting.md` covering common issues like skipped jobs, false positive version checks, publishing failures, and secret configuration.

- **Enhanced Error Handling in publish-crate.mjs**: Added specific detection and helpful error messages for authentication failures, including guidance on secret configuration and workflow setup.

- **Case Study Documentation**: Added comprehensive case study at `docs/case-studies/issue-21/` analyzing CI/CD failures from browser-commander repository (issues #27, #29, #31, #33) with timeline, root causes, and lessons learned.

### Fixed

- **Prevent False Positive Version Checks**: The release workflow now correctly identifies unpublished versions by checking crates.io instead of relying on git tags, which can exist without the package being published.

### Changed

- Translated all CI/CD scripts from JavaScript (.mjs) to Rust (.rs) using rust-script
- Scripts now use native Rust with rust-script for execution in shell
- Removed Node.js dependency from CI/CD pipeline
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use rust-script instead of node
- Updated README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with new script references

### Added

- Cache `restore-keys` for partial cache hits across all workflow jobs
- Explicit `token` parameter in checkout for release jobs
- Code coverage job with `cargo-llvm-cov` and Codecov integration
- Codecov badge in README.md
- Pre-release version support (e.g., `0.1.0-beta.1`) in version parsing
- `--release-label` parameter for multi-language release disambiguation
- `ensure_version_exceeds_published()` logic to prevent publishing duplicate versions
- `get_max_published_version()` to query highest non-yanked version from crates.io
- `max_published_version` output from check-release-needed for downstream use
- Version fallback logic in auto-release Create GitHub Release step

### Changed

- Updated `actions/checkout` from v4 to v6
- Updated `actions/cache` from v4 to v5
- Updated `peter-evans/create-pull-request` from v7 to v8
- Made `publish-crate.rs` fail (exit 1) when version already exists on crates.io
- Improved `create-github-release.rs` to check combined stdout+stderr and detect "Validation Failed"

### Fixed

- Fix publish steps overriding workflow-level CARGO_TOKEN fallback, breaking CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN-only configurations (#32)
- Fix non-fast-forward push failures in multi-workflow repos by adding fetch/rebase and push retry logic (#31)
- Add mono-repo path support to check-changelog-fragment.rs, check-version-modification.rs, and create-changelog-fragment.rs
- Add `!cancelled()` guard to test job condition to respect workflow cancellation

### Fixed

- Fixed `version-and-commit.rs` to check crates.io instead of git tags for determining if a version is already released
- This prevents the release pipeline from getting stuck when git tags exist without corresponding crates.io publication

### Added

- Added `--tag-prefix` support to `version-and-commit.rs` for multi-language repository compatibility
- Added crates.io and docs.rs badges to README.md
- Added automatic crates.io and docs.rs badge injection in GitHub release notes
- Added documentation deployment job to CI/CD pipeline (deploys to GitHub Pages after release)
- Added case study documentation for issue #25

### Fixed
- Fixed unsupported look-ahead regex in `create-github-release.rs` that caused a panic when parsing CHANGELOG.md. Replaced with a two-step approach using only features supported by Rust's `regex` crate.

### Changed
- Restructured example application as a simple CLI sum calculator using `lino-arguments`
- Renamed default package to `example-sum-package-name` with Unlicense license
- Reorganized test structure: `tests/unit/sum.rs`, `tests/integration/sum.rs`, `tests/unit/ci-cd/`
- Converted experiment scripts into proper unit tests in `tests/unit/ci-cd/changelog_parsing.rs`
- Added CI/CD skip logic for template default package name `example-sum-package-name`
- Updated README.md badges and documentation

### Fixed

- Change detection script now uses per-commit diff instead of full PR diff, so commits touching only non-code files correctly skip CI jobs even when earlier commits in the same PR changed code files

### Fixed
- Make release scripts resolve the publishable crate manifest when the repository root uses a Cargo workspace manifest.

### Fixed
- Decoupled GitHub Pages documentation deployment from package release publication and fixed release-script warning failures under `RUSTFLAGS=-Dwarnings`.

### Changed
- Added explicit GitHub Actions job timeouts and documented Rust test timeout guidance.

### Fixed
- Added a non-blocking warning threshold to the Rust file-size check so near-limit files are surfaced before concurrent PR merges can exceed the hard limit.

### Fixed
- Made `create-github-release.rs` build GitHub release titles as `[Language] X.Y.Z` instead of reusing the tag prefix.

### Added
- Added optional Docker Hub image publishing tied to Rust crate releases, including crates.io visibility waiting, version/latest image tags, and Docker Hub badges in GitHub release notes.

### Changed
- Release completeness checks now self-heal when crates.io exists but configured Docker Hub or GitHub release artifacts are missing.

### Fixed
- Switched documentation deployment to the official GitHub Pages artifact workflow so repositories using GitHub Actions as their Pages source do not get false-positive branch-push deploys.

- Updated `actions/cache` from v4 to v5
- Updated `peter-evans/create-pull-request` from v7 to v8
- Made `publish-crate.rs` fail (exit 1) when version already exists on crates.io
- Improved `create-github-release.rs` to check combined stdout+stderr and detect "Validation Failed"

### Fixed

- Fix publish steps overriding workflow-level CARGO_TOKEN fallback, breaking CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN-only configurations (#32)
- Fix non-fast-forward push failures in multi-workflow repos by adding fetch/rebase and push retry logic (#31)
- Add mono-repo path support to check-changelog-fragment.rs, check-version-modification.rs, and create-changelog-fragment.rs
- Add `!cancelled()` guard to test job condition to respect workflow cancellation

### Fixed

- Fixed `version-and-commit.rs` to check crates.io instead of git tags for determining if a version is already released
- This prevents the release pipeline from getting stuck when git tags exist without corresponding crates.io publication

### Added

- Added `--tag-prefix` support to `version-and-commit.rs` for multi-language repository compatibility
- Added crates.io and docs.rs badges to README.md
- Added automatic crates.io and docs.rs badge injection in GitHub release notes
- Added documentation deployment job to CI/CD pipeline (deploys to GitHub Pages after release)
- Added case study documentation for issue #25

### Fixed
- Fixed unsupported look-ahead regex in `create-github-release.rs` that caused a panic when parsing CHANGELOG.md. Replaced with a two-step approach using only features supported by Rust's `regex` crate.

### Changed
- Restructured example application as a simple CLI sum calculator using `lino-arguments`
- Renamed default package to `example-sum-package-name` with Unlicense license
- Reorganized test structure: `tests/unit/sum.rs`, `tests/integration/sum.rs`, `tests/unit/ci-cd/`
- Converted experiment scripts into proper unit tests in `tests/unit/ci-cd/changelog_parsing.rs`
- Added CI/CD skip logic for template default package name `example-sum-package-name`
- Updated README.md badges and documentation

### Fixed
- Make release scripts resolve the publishable crate manifest when the repository root uses a Cargo workspace manifest.

### Fixed
- Decoupled GitHub Pages documentation deployment from package release publication and fixed release-script warning failures under `RUSTFLAGS=-Dwarnings`.

### Changed
- Added explicit GitHub Actions job timeouts and documented Rust test timeout guidance.

### Fixed
- Added a non-blocking warning threshold to the Rust file-size check so near-limit files are surfaced before concurrent PR merges can exceed the hard limit.

- Fixed example code in README.md that had invalid Rust with two `main` functions

### Added

- Added crates.io publishing support to CI/CD workflow
- Added `release_mode` input with "instant" and "changelog-pr" options for manual releases
- Added `--tag-prefix` and `--crates-io-url` options to create-github-release.mjs script
- Added comprehensive case study documentation for Issue #11 in docs/case-studies/issue-11/

### Changed

- Changed changelog fragment check from warning to error (exit 1) to enforce changelog requirements
- Updated job conditions with `always() && !cancelled()` to fix workflow_dispatch job skipping issue
- Renamed manual-release job to "Instant Release" for clarity

### Fixed

- Fixed deprecated `::set-output` GitHub Actions command in version-and-commit.mjs
- Fixed workflow_dispatch triggering issues where lint/build/release jobs were incorrectly skipped

### Fixed

- Fixed changelog fragment check to validate that a fragment is **added in the PR diff** rather than just checking if any fragments exist in the directory. This prevents the check from incorrectly passing when there are leftover fragments from previous PRs that haven't been released yet.

### Changed

- Converted shell scripts in `release.yml` to cross-platform `.mjs` scripts for improved portability and performance:
  - `check-changelog-fragment.mjs` - validates changelog fragment is added in PR diff
  - `git-config.mjs` - configures git user for CI/CD
  - `check-release-needed.mjs` - checks if release is needed
  - `publish-crate.mjs` - publishes package to crates.io
  - `create-changelog-fragment.mjs` - creates changelog fragments for manual releases
  - `get-version.mjs` - gets current version from Cargo.toml

### Added

- Added `check-version-modification.mjs` script to detect manual version changes in Cargo.toml
- Added `version-check` job to CI/CD workflow that runs on pull requests
- Added skip logic for automated release branches (changelog-manual-release-*, changeset-release/*, release/*, automated-release/*)

### Changed

- Version modifications in Cargo.toml are now blocked in pull requests to enforce automated release pipeline

### Added

- Added support for `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` as alternative to `CARGO_TOKEN` for crates.io publishing
- Added case study documentation for Issue #17 (yargs reserved word and dual token support)

### Changed

- Updated workflow to use fallback logic: `${{ secrets.CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN || secrets.CARGO_TOKEN }}`
- Improved publish-crate.mjs to check both `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` and `CARGO_TOKEN` environment variables
- Added warning message when neither token is set

### Added
- New `scripts/rust-paths.mjs` utility for automatic Rust package root detection
- Support for both single-language and multi-language repository structures in all CI/CD scripts
- Configuration options via `--rust-root` CLI argument and `RUST_ROOT` environment variable
- Comprehensive case study documentation in `docs/case-studies/issue-19/`

### Changed
- Updated all release scripts to use the new path detection utility:
  - `scripts/bump-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/check-release-needed.mjs`

### Added

- **CI/CD Troubleshooting Guide**: New documentation at `docs/ci-cd/troubleshooting.md` covering common issues like skipped jobs, false positive version checks, publishing failures, and secret configuration.

- **Enhanced Error Handling in publish-crate.mjs**: Added specific detection and helpful error messages for authentication failures, including guidance on secret configuration and workflow setup.

- **Case Study Documentation**: Added comprehensive case study at `docs/case-studies/issue-21/` analyzing CI/CD failures from browser-commander repository (issues #27, #29, #31, #33) with timeline, root causes, and lessons learned.

### Fixed

- **Prevent False Positive Version Checks**: The release workflow now correctly identifies unpublished versions by checking crates.io instead of relying on git tags, which can exist without the package being published.

### Changed

- Translated all CI/CD scripts from JavaScript (.mjs) to Rust (.rs) using rust-script
- Scripts now use native Rust with rust-script for execution in shell
- Removed Node.js dependency from CI/CD pipeline
